Dependency Injection:-

Let's imagine that you want to go fishing:
Without dependency injection, you need to take care of everything yourself. You need to find a boat, to buy 
a fishing rod, to look for baot, etc. It's possible, of course, but it puts a lot of responsibility on you. 
In software terms, it means that you have to perform a lookup for all these things.
With dependency injection, someone else takes care of all the preparation and makes the required equipment 
available to you. You will receive ("be injected") the boat, the fishing rod and the bait - all ready to use.
