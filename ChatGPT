---

## 🧵 **Multithreading and Concurrency**
- Explain the difference between `synchronized` block and `synchronized` method.
-> In Java, the synchronized keyword is used to ensure that only one thread can access a block of code or method at a time,
 preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.
     1. Synchronized Method
   Definition: A synchronized method locks the entire method, meaning only one thread can execute it at a time for a
    particular object instance.
   Locking Mechanism: The lock is applied on the object instance (this) for instance methods or the class-level lock for
    static methods.
   Scope of Synchronization: It locks the entire method, meaning no other thread can execute any synchronized method of
   the same object until the current thread releases the lock.
   Ease of Use: Easier to implement when the whole method requires synchronization.

   Example of Synchronized Method:
   public class Counter {
       private int count = 0;
       public synchronized void increment() {
           count++;
       }
       public synchronized int getCount() {
           return count;
       }
   }
   Explanation: The synchronized keyword ensures that only one thread can call increment() or getCount() at a time.

   2. Synchronized Block
   Definition: A synchronized block allows you to lock only a specific portion of code instead of the whole method. It is
    more fine-grained and efficient.
   Locking Mechanism: You can choose the object to lock using synchronized (object) which could be this, a specific object,
    or a class-level lock using ClassName.class.
   Scope of Synchronization: Only the block of code within the synchronized block is locked, allowing other threads to execute
   non-synchronized parts of the method.
   Performance: Offers better performance compared to synchronized methods when only part of the code requires synchronization.
   Example of Synchronized Block:
   public class Counter {
       private int count = 0;
       private final Object lock = new Object();

       public void increment() {
           synchronized (lock) {
               count++;
           }
       }

       public int getCount() {
           synchronized (lock) {
               return count;
           }
       }
   }
   Explanation: Here, the lock is applied only on the critical section (count++ and return count). Other non-critical code
   can run concurrently.

- How does the `ThreadLocal` class work? Provide a use case.

- What is the difference between `Callable` and `Runnable`?
- Explain the concept of a **Thread Pool**. How would you create and manage it using `ExecutorService`?
- What is a **Deadlock**? How would you detect and resolve it?
- Explain the difference between `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier`.
-> Both CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier are synchronization utilities in Java's java.util.concurrent package, used to
coordinate multiple threads. However, they serve different purposes and operate in distinct ways.

   🔎 Key Differences Between CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier
   Feature	                        CountDownLatch	                                            CyclicBarrier
   Purpose	  Used to make one or more threads wait until a set of operations are completed.
                                                           Used to synchronize multiple threads at a common barrier point.
   Reset      Behavior Cannot be reset once the count reaches zero.
                                                          Can be reset and reused using the reset() method.
   Usage	  Best for one-time events like application startup tasks.
                                                          Best for cyclic tasks like simulations or iterative processes.
   Thread Control	Threads wait using await(), and the latch count is decremented using countDown().
   	                                    Threads wait using await(), and all threads proceed once the barrier is reached.
   Reusability	Not reusable once the count reaches zero.	                Reusable after all threads reach the barrier.
   Exception Handling	No additional exception handling at the latch.
                                                Supports a barrier action that can run once all threads reach the barrier.
   Number of Threads Involved	-> The waiting threads are usually different from the ones decrementing the latch.
   	                                                                All participating threads wait at the barrier point.
   State Management	Simple count mechanism.                       	Maintains barrier state and can detect barrier breaks.


- How does `ReentrantLock` differ from `synchronized`?       -> remaining not understand
-> Both ReentrantLock and synchronized are used to achieve thread synchronization in Java, but they have different features
 and capabilities.

   Overview
   ReentrantLock is a class from the java.util.concurrent.locks package, introduced in Java 5.
   synchronized is a built-in Java keyword that has been part of Java since the beginning.

- Provide an example of using `CompletableFuture` for asynchronous programming.

---

## 📦 **Exception Handling**
- Explain checked vs unchecked exceptions with examples.
- What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?

- How would you create a custom exception in Java?
-> Creating a **custom exception** in Java is useful when you want to represent specific error conditions in your application using meaningful exception
messages. Custom exceptions typically extend the `Exception` class (for checked exceptions) or the `RuntimeException` class
(for unchecked exceptions).
   ## ✅ **Steps to Create a Custom Exception**
   1. **Create a Class:**
       - Define a class that extends either `Exception` (checked) or `RuntimeException` (unchecked).
   2. **Provide Constructors:**
       - Provide constructors to initialize the exception message and optionally a cause.
   3. **Throw the Custom Exception:**
       - Use the `throw` keyword to throw the exception in appropriate conditions.

   ## 📌 **Example 1: Creating a Checked Custom Exception**
   - **Checked exceptions** must be handled using `try-catch` or declared using `throws`.

   ### **Custom Checked Exception Class**
   // Extending Exception to create a Checked Exception
   public class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {

       // Constructor with custom message
       public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
           super(message);
       }
   }
   ### **Using the Custom Exception**
   public class CheckedExceptionDemo {
       // Method to validate age using throws
       public static void validateAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
           if (age < 18) {
               throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or above.");
           } else {
               System.out.println("Age validated successfully.");
           }
       }
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try {
               validateAge(16); // Throws InvalidAgeException
           } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
               System.out.println("Exception: " + e.getMessage());
           }
       }
   }  🔎 **Explanation:**
   - `InvalidAgeException` is a checked exception, so it must be handled using `try-catch` or declared using `throws`.

   ## 📌 **Example 2: Creating an Unchecked Custom Exception**
   - **Unchecked exceptions** extend `RuntimeException` and do not require explicit handling.
   ### **Custom Unchecked Exception Class**
   // Extending RuntimeException to create an Unchecked Exception
   public class InsufficientFundsException extends RuntimeException {
       // Constructor with custom message
       public InsufficientFundsException(String message) {
           super(message);
       }
   }
   ### **Using the Custom Exception**
   public class UncheckedExceptionDemo {
       private double balance = 1000;
       // Method to withdraw funds
       public void withdraw(double amount) {
           if (amount > balance) {
               throw new InsufficientFundsException("Insufficient funds. Available balance: " + balance);
           } else {
               balance -= amount;
               System.out.println("Withdrawal successful. Remaining balance: " + balance);
           }
       }
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           UncheckedExceptionDemo account = new UncheckedExceptionDemo();
           account.withdraw(1500); // Throws InsufficientFundsException
       }
   }   🔎 **Explanation:**
   - `InsufficientFundsException` is an unchecked exception, meaning the compiler does not enforce handling.
   - It is suitable for programming logic errors.
   ## 🔎 **Key Differences Between Checked and Unchecked Custom Exceptions**

 | Aspect             | Checked Exception (`Exception`)                   | Unchecked Exception (`RuntimeException`)           |
 |--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
 | **Handling**       | Must be handled using `try-catch` or declared using `throws` | No requirement for explicit handling |
 | **Use Case**       | For scenarios where the program can recover (e.g., file not found) | For programming errors (e.g., null pointer, invalid input) |
 | **Example**        | `InvalidAgeException`                            | `InsufficientFundsException`                       |
 | **Recommendation** | Use for recoverable situations                   | Use for logical errors that shouldn't occur        |

   ## ✅ **Bonus: Best Practices for Custom Exceptions**
   1. **Meaningful Class Names:** Name your exceptions clearly, e.g., `InvalidUserException`, `ProductNotFoundException`.
   2. **Provide Constructors:** Add constructors to accept custom messages and exception causes.
   3. **Add Contextual Information:** Include relevant details in the message for easier debugging.
   4. **Document the Exception:** Provide Javadoc comments explaining when the exception is thrown.
   5. **Avoid Using for Control Flow:** Do not use exceptions to manage normal application flow.

- What happens if an exception is thrown in a `finally` block?
-> When an exception is thrown inside a **finally** block, it can lead to specific behaviors depending on how the code is
structured. The finally block is typically used for cleanup operations (e.g., closing resources), and it always executes
after the try or catch blocks — whether or not an exception is thrown.
✅ What Happens When an Exception is Thrown in a finally Block?
   Exception in finally Overwrites Previous Exceptions:
If both the try block and the finally block throw exceptions, the exception thrown in the finally block will suppress the
exception from the try or catch block.
  Uncaught Exception Propagation:
 If an exception is thrown in the finally block and not handled, it will propagate further up the call stack, potentially
crashing the program.
   Loss of Original Exception:
The original exception may be lost if not properly handled, making debugging difficult.
addSuppressed()
To prevent the loss of the original exception, you can use Throwable.addSuppressed() to attach the original exception as
a suppressed one.

- How would you handle multiple exceptions in a single block using Java 7+?
-> In Java 7 and later, you can handle multiple exceptions using a single catch block. This feature is known as multi-catch.
It simplifies exception handling by reducing code redundancy when multiple exceptions are handled similarly.
✅ Handling Multiple Exceptions Using Multi-Catch (Java 7+)
Syntax: You can catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block by using the pipe (|) operator.
Purpose: It is useful when different exceptions require the same handling logic.
Restriction: The exceptions should not have a parent-child relationship (e.g., IOException | FileNotFoundException is invalid
since FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException).

✅ Key Rules for Multi-Catch Blocks
No Parent-Child Exceptions: You cannot catch exceptions in a parent-child relationship using |.
// Invalid example
catch (IOException | FileNotFoundException e) {
    // This will not compile because FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException
}

Single Exception Object: The exception object e is implicitly final, meaning you cannot reassign it.
catch (IOException | SQLException e) {
    e = new IOException(); // Compilation Error - e is final
}
Common Handling Logic: Multi-catch blocks are best used when the handling logic for all exceptions is similar.
