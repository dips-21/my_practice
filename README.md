Virtual table:-
=====================
Every object holds a pointer to a class handle, which contains a vtable. 
This pointer is set as soon as the object is allocated (with NEW) and before any constructors are called. 
So in Java, it is safe for constructors to make virtual method calls,
and they will be properly directed to the target's implementation of the virtual method.

Public static void main:-
================================
First public means that any other object can access it.
static means that the class in which it resides doesn't have to be instantiated first before the function can be called.
void means that the function does not return a value.
"main" means an entry point you can "run".

Yes, We can overload the main method in java but JVM only calls the original main method,
it will never call our overloaded main method.
 
/Protected - 
======================================
access in same package and child class   other classes through class
eg SimpleList ,protected elements[]
DynamicList extends SimpleList use elements[]

Protected data member and method are only accessible by the classes of the same package and the subclasses present in 
any package. You can also say that the protected access modifier is similar to default access modifier with one
exception that it has visibility in sub classes.
Classes cannot be declared protected. This access modifier is generally used in a parent child relationship.


private - 
======================================
If a class has private constructor then you cannot create the object of that class from outside of the class.
access within the inner class. private or any other can be static.

USE:- validation and controlled,or immutable object.
      less complexity

public -   throughout  the class.throughout the all package.
=======================
The members, methods and classes that are declared public can be accessed from anywhere. 
This modifier doesn’t put any restriction on the access
======================================
Default -  package level. 
======================================
            
JVM:-  Java virtual machine is an abstract machine.It is specification that provides run time environment in which java 
bytecode can be executed.JVM performs loads code,verifies code,executes code,provides run time env.
JVM provides the memory area,class file format,register set ,garbage collector heap.

CLassloader is sub type of jvm which loads the class files.whenever we run the program it is loaded first by the classloadder.
* bootstrap classloader- it loads the jar.file which contains all class files of java std edition like java.lang package,
java.util,java.io package 

extension:-This is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of system classloader.

system/Application classloader:- this is the child classloader of extension classloader.It loads the classfiles from
classpath. by default,classpath is set to current directory.

Execution Engine:-It contains
===============================
Interpreter :-read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.

Just in time(JIT)compiler:-here compiler refers to translator from the instruction set of a java virtual machine to 
instruction set of specific cpu. A Virtual processor.

Constructor:-
===================
A constructor initializes an object when it is created.It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar 
to a method. 
However, constructors have no explicit return type.
Typically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, 
or to perform any other start-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.
All classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default 
constructor that initializes all member variables to zero. However, once you define your own constructor, 
the default constructor is no longer used.

Encapsulation - (data fields) 
======================================
Encapsulation in Java is achieved using access modifiers (private, protected, public) to restrict direct access to
class members. It ensures data hiding and maintains control over how data is accessed and modified. Getters and
setters are commonly used to enforce controlled access to private variables..

It's an oop term, Binding method and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
we can hide only data fields in it.like the scope of resize an array is inside the class only
 so we can hide it from others.
  ArrayList versus array ,array has no encapsulation .Arraylist add hides complexity of resize when it's full.
* Encapsulation is data hiding it allows to have valid states of object.
  *field is private n methods are public.
  *we can reuse our code.
  *we can do validation at one level.(age is not be negative then we can check it at one level.)
  
  
["dipali","mona","sona","mina"]     To store a TrekkingGroup information of person if we take 3 arrays names[],ages[],cities[] 
25         29      33    16         if we add remove in one array then
P           M      A      N          data of persons can be mismatch if we didnt make changes in other array,bcz one person data
After deletion                      is not encapsulated.Instead of this we can take Person array, Person[] where person 
["dipali","sona","mina"]            has name age and city then it has some encapsulation ,while modifying data of one peroson 
                                    will not affect on data of another person if person array is full 
25         29      33    16         resizing group or condition like add only between 18 to 25 age group must be added in group
                                    ,it has to be done everywhere  where person is added to group.
P           M      A      N       
                                    If we make a  TrekkingGroup class with private Person array or list then in addMember
class TrekkingGroup{                 method any validation can be performed and group data in encapsulated inside it.
private Person[] members;
addMember(Person p){
validate age is >18 <60
if  array is full then resize
};
removeMember();
}
[a relative link] (src/test/java/coreJava/encapsulation/TrekkingGroupTest.java)
//Java Heap
person1<<name,age,city  >>    person2<<name,age,city>>  //one person can access only his/her data  fields directly

  * Data is modified at one place because fields are private and it is accessible only within the class.
    only this method can direct access of it.n others from getters and setters method.
 
    Benefits: reduces complexity ,better control over data
    
Abstraction:- (types of implementation hiding)
=================================================
Data abstraction: Representation of essential features excluding their background details is known as 
data abstraction.

Abstraction hides concrete implementation type.like we can have a CheckIfEqual method which is used to 
check equality for arraylist,linkedList.  
List is an abstraction of arraylist and linkedlist so CheckIfEqual which takes two parameters as a list
not arraylist n linked list.(List<Integer> listOne,List<Integer> listTwo)
same method can be used to check if two linkedlist or arraylist are equal.
CheckIfEqual(List<Integer> listOne,List<Integer> listTwo)
AbstractionCodeReuseTest

loose coupling : If there is a UserService and it has an abstract type SqlRepo then 
                 it is loosely coupled and if the implementation
                 changes from MySqlRepo to MongoRepo then UserService does not need to change.
implemented using interface and abstract class
UserServiceTest
it can be method body.

Example:-
=========
In system there is 3 kind of user men women and child.if we have to add User then we will have to call 
three separate methods for them but with the help of abstraction we can define abstract type of it which 
is person.
If those three classes has same functionality then we can add it in person class and override it into 
child class with extends keyword.

Inheritance:-
==================================================
*When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, and they are in hierarchy
it is known as inheritance. 
*It provides code reusability. 
*It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism,  
*In that we can allows code defined in one class and other classes can be reused it.

*Ex.if we have a women class ,in that  we have taken  working and non working women .means we can inherit all the 
properties of women in both the classes and also we can add others information in it like working women get salary.
so we dont have to write women functionality to the both sub classes.
AgeWeightComparator AgeWeightHeightComparator,we can override(modify) specific behavior (only methods that we need)
,rest of methods will be accessible from parent class 

HeightWeightHairLengthComparator

 equals hashcode toString      
Class Child extends Object{
}
Child c 
c.toString

Class Child{
Object obj
boolean equals(Object o){
obj.equals(o);
}
}
c.equals

Polymorphism:-
==================================================
Polymorphism is the capability of a method to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon. 
In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
* In polymorphism, calls resolved  dynamically on correct object type.
* It is also known as dynamic dispatch methods because method called resolved on run time type of object.

Example:--we have a woman, man and child class and in that get hobby is a method.when we call to getHobby
of person then it will call on correct run time type of object and gives actual class hobby,
*overridden happens in run time type of polymorphism.


**Overloading
===================
In the same class there can be methods with same name but different parameters, different datatypes,the decision on
which method will be called is made on the compile time type of parameters.The most specific matching
method is called. If there is no unique match then it's a compile time error. 
*it must be in same classes.                            
*the called resolved on compile time type of object.
* we can change access modifier.

*static,*private ,final  method be overloaded.                   

* compile time polymorphism (because the method called varies depending on compile time type of parameters)

Eg.List has add(position,element)   //list has add method and it takes position and element.
       list.add(element) ,             //n other one is list takes only (element)
      list.add(10)                      //if we call on list.add(10) then it will call on list.add(10) 


**Overriding Polymorphism
===========================
When the method being called is present in multiple classes which are in an inheritance hierarchy then the
decision to call which method is based on run time type of the object. object has virtual pointer n it points
to virtual table. virtual table of it's class has location of all function of that class.

*it must follow inheritance hierarchy.
*private or static or final cannot be overridden.
*we cannot decrease the visibility of method when overriding.(if parent scope is
default then in child class it can be public but not private ).
//for eg addAll uses add ,if we could override add and make it private ,that would break addAll.
*The protected method can be made public but not private in the subclass.
* Run time polymorphism. non-static non-final method can be overridden. 
  *If the method is static ,it will be called on class only and can't be overridden
  *If we provide lesser access in the subclass than that in the superclass, then we will get a compile-time error.
  *private and final can't be overridden  ,final College class getFees() ,
                                          College college=new College() ; college.getFees();
  final class cant be overridden

override example
==============================
Ex...If we take Loan as abstract class and it has three implementation class personal loan,home loan and gold loan.
and there is getRateOfInterest method().If we take loan.getRateOfInterest(new homeloan) it will gives the homeLoan\.
======================================================================================================================
Eg. HashCode And Equals:-
put(key,value)  get(key,value)

if we override the hashCode and equals Map.put and map.get method takes generic parameters.It calls hashCode of key object
to get bucket position.bcz of overriding(polymorphism) it will call on correct key object.

java.lang.object    person   man

map.put(man,10)    <---it will internally calls on hashCode of man class to find bucket position.
key.equal(map.entry.key)                     entry<- key value n next  <-node
It will call equals from correct man class.


//IMP-> if the method is non-static then override method is resolved on run time type of its object on which method
is being called.

In SOLID
=======================
Answer: SOLID principles guide object-oriented design to create maintainable, scalable code:
 S - Single Responsibility Principle:  
o A class should have one reason to change.
o Example: Separate UserService (handles user data) from EmailService (sends emails).
o Violation: A User class that also logs errors.

 O - Open/Closed Principle:  
o Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.
o Example:  
interface PaymentProcessor { void process(); }
class CreditCardProcessor implements PaymentProcessor { public void process() { /* logic */ } }
class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor { public void process() { /* logic */ } }
o Violation: Modifying a Payment class to add new payment types.

 L - Liskov Substitution on Principle:  
o Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
o Example: A Bird interface with fly() should not be implemented by Ostrich (which
can’t fly).
o Correct: Separate FlyingBird interface.

L is liskov substitution principle means ,if a method works on parent type it should work on child type also.
for eg.addAll works on ArrayList , MyArrayList extends ArrayList and overrides add to make it
private then addAll will break

 I - Interface Segregation on Principle:
o Clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.
o Example: Split a large Worker interface into Eatable and Workable.
o Violation: A Printer class implementing an irrelevant Scan method.

 D - Dependency Inversion Principle:  
o Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
o Example:  
interface Database { void save(); }
class MySQLDatabase implements Database { public void save() { /* logic */ } }
class Service {
private Database db;
Service(Database db) { this.db = db; } // Inject abstraction
}
o Violation: Hardcoding MySQLDatabase in Service.

What to Highlight:
 How SOLID improves code maintainability.
 Real-world examples (e.g., Spring’s use of DI).
 Trade-offs (e.g., ISP may increase interface count).

Interface:-
==================================================
Interface is a type defines contract what behaviour it must have to do of that type.
It defines what but not how methods do.
ex. to be human you have to implements all methods in interface like walk,talk,
It provides loose coupling.
Interface can extend interface.

 * It is mechanism to achieve full abstraction.
 * There can be only abstract methods in the java interface not method body.
 * It contains a declaration part only.

Multiple inheritance can be achieved using interface.
It doesn’t contain a constructor.
It doesn’t contain static members.
It contains public access modifier since everything in an interface is considered public.
The performance of interface is not good.
It is slow since it needs time to search for an actual method in the respective class.
It is used to implement peripheral abilities of a class.
It can use multiple interface.
If multiple implementations share methods, then the ‘Interface’ can be used.
Interface can contain methods only.
It needs to be fully implemented.

Abstract Class:-
=======================
if we know Partial implementation.
It contains the declaration and definition part.
Multiple inheritance can’t be implemented using abstract class.
It contains the constructor.
It can also contain some static members.
It can contain multiple types of access modifiers such as public, private, protected.
The performance of an abstract class is very good, because it is quick.
It is used to implement the core identity/functionality of a class.
A class can use only one abstract class.
If many implementations are same, and they have a common behaviour, it is suggested to use an abstract class.
Abstract classes contain methods, fields, constants.
It can be fully implemented, partially implemented or not even implemented.

String BUILDER/BUFFER-
==================================================
Strings are immutable so if we want to change it ,everytime new object will have to be created.
because everytime we created string object it will check in string pool and if it exists in string pool the 
reference will be provided to given string object.
if object doesn't exist's in string pool then it will create new object n heap space is also used wisely in this.
if string is mutable then everytime if we change the string and if it's pointing to same reference variable then 
everywhere the same string is present it will change but with the help of buffer/builder we can append it n modify it.

StringBuffer is thread-safe since it is synchronised.
It means that two threads can’t execute the StringBuffer functions at the same time.
If they call the StringBuffer function at the same time, only one of the two threads acquires the lock and
executes the method. The second thread has to wait until the execution of the first thread has been completed.
String Buffer is considered to be less efficient than String Builder.
String Buffer was introduced in Java 1.0.

StringBuilder is not thread-safe because it is not synchronised. 
It indicates that two threads can use StringBuilder’s methods at the same time.
In this case, no thread has to wait for the execution of the other thread.
String Builder is considered to be more efficient than String Buffer.
String Builder was introduced in Java 1.5.

builder And buffer- buffer is synchronized.(objects shared by multiple threads)
=====================
String is thread safe.

StringBuffer:-
=======================
StringBuffer in java is used to create modifiable String objects. 
This means that we can use StringBuffer to append, reverse, replace, concatenate and manipulate Strings or 
sequence of characters.

If we want  friends list from different sources then we have to take append(method) from single thread
then string Builder is used.
Buffer is already synchronized n it uses multiple thread.  
============================================================
If a string is going to remain constant throughout the program, then use the String class object because a
String object is immutable.===============================

If a string can change (for example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string)
and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.

If a string can change and will be accessed from multiple threads, use a StringBuffer because StringBuffer
is synchronous, so you have thread-safety.

If you don’t want thread-safety than you can also go with StringBuilder class as it is not synchronized.

Intern -
============
This method searches the specified string in the memory pool and if it is found then it returns the reference of it, 
else it allocates the memory space to the specified string and assign the reference to it.
returns the canonical representation of the string

**Comparable And Comparator:-
==================================
            Comparable                                             
*comparable interface is used to compare single elements    
*A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object                                                
*It has compareTo() method.                                   
*It is in java.lang.package                                  

syntax--
compareTo(one object passed to compare with this.object itself)

Comparison logic is coupled in comparable .
comparable is tightly coupled with that class to check object comparison.
It is also used to compare the current instance with another object of same type.

            Comparator
*Comparator interface is used to compare two or multiple elements.
*The Comparer interface is used to sort elements that compare two objects and provides additional comparison method.
*It implements comparable.
*It has compare() method to compare. 
*it is in java.util package
syntax--compare(two objects passed )

comparable and comparator returns positive negative and 0 values.
* If the first element is greater than second then it returns -1 negative integar.
  * If the second element is greater than first then it returns 1 positive integar.
  * If both objects are equal then it returns 0 value.
  * It throws null pointer exception if we pass null values to them.

Logically, Comparable interface compares “this” reference with the object specified 
and Comparator in Java compares two different class objects provided.

we can write more than one custom comparators as you want for a given type, 
comparable example we could just sort by only one attribute,
i.e., age but in the comparator,we can use different attributes like weight, name, and year.

**ASSOCIATION: Association
================================
Association refers to the relationship between multiple objects. 
It refers to how objects are related to each other and how they are using each other's functionality.
Composition and aggregation are two types of association.

Aggregation and Composition
==============================
Aggregation
==============
Aggregation is a way to achieve Association.
Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent.

For example, Bank and Employee, delete the Bank and the Employee still exist.

It represents the weak relationship between objects.
It is another way to reuse objects.

Aggregation  - Tell 
=============
Aggregation is a weak association. 
An association is said to be aggregation if both Objects can exist independently. 
For example, a Team object and a Player object.
The team contains multiple players but a player can exist without a team.

Composition   HAS -A - RELATIONSHIP
====================================
The composition is also a way to achieve Association. 
The composition represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. 
Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent.
There is a strong relationship between the containing object and the dependent object.
It is the state where containing objects do not have an independent existence. 
If you delete the parent object, all the child objects will be deleted automatically.

The composition is the strong type of association.
If an Object depends on another object and another object cannot exist without the owner object. 
Consider the case of Human having a heart. 
Here Human object contains the heart and heart cannot exist without Human.

Generics:-
================
//Java generic feature added into java language from java5.
Generic allows us to create parametrized types ,we can re-use same class with different type parameters.
The compiler checks at compile time if all usages of that instance match the specified parameter type in generics .
For eg->List<String> list=new ArrayList<>() , list is one instance and it's usages will be checked by compiler for type match
We can create List<String>, List<Integer> or list of any type with the same List class and it gives compile time safety
as we can only add or get strings in a List<String> .
Without generics ,for eg in a raw type list we can add multiple type in list but
at run time we have to type cast it from Object to our specific type and it can fail
with classCastException ,if the type is not correct.The responsibility is on caller of List to type cast it correctly.

If we have a list n we added string to it  get from list n assign to integer then it will allow but
it will fail at run time with class cast exception.,
but with generics it would be compiler error.
Java generic gives compile time safety.

Generics also done by inserting casts but compiler checks all usages are matching the
parameterised type so it can't fail.
Type erasure , generics are erased after compilation.

Solutions on Producer and Consumer Problems:-
=================================================

Exceptions:-
----------------------
Exception vs error;-
=====================
Exceptions and errors both are subclasses of Throwable class.
The error indicates a problem that mainly occurs due to the lack of system resources and our application should not catch 
these types of problems.Some of the examples of errors are system crash error and out of memory error.
Errors mostly occur at runtime that's they belong to an unchecked type.

Exceptions are the problems which can occur at runtime and compile time.
It mainly occurs in the code written by the developers.  
Exceptions are divided into two categories such as checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.

Sr. No.	                                    Key	Error	                                            Exception

                                Classified as an unchecked type                     Classified as checked and unchecked

2  .                                          Package
                                    It belongs to java.lang.error                      It belongs to java.lang.Exception

3                                  Recoverable/ Irrecoverable
                                       It is irrecoverable                              It is recoverable


4                              It can't be occur at compile time
Example
                                OutOfMemoryError,IOError                               NullPointerException,SqlException



Checked Exceptions
=============================
A checked exception is an exception that occurs at the compile time, these are also called as compile time exceptions.
These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation;
the programmer should take care of (handle) these exceptions.
Checked exceptions must be handled either by using try and catch block or by using throws clause in the method declaration.
If not handles properly, it will give a compile-time error.

For example, if you use FileReader class in your program to read data from a file,
if the file specified in its constructor doesn't exist, then a FileNotFoundException occurs,
and the compiler prompts the programmer to handle the exception.

ClassNotFoundException ,InterruptedException ,InstantiationException ,IOException,SQLException
IllegalAccessException ,FileNotFoundException, etc

The compiler checks for a checked exception.
It is a sub-class of the exception class.
The JVM requires that the exception be caught and handled.
Example of Checked exception- ‘File Not Found Exception’

Unchecked Exceptions
================================
These exceptions occur at runtime.
The compiler doesn’t check for these kinds of exceptions.
These kinds of exceptions can’t be caught or handled during compilation time.
This is because the exceptions are generated due to the mistakes in the program.
These are not a part of the ‘Exception’ class since they are runtime exceptions.
The JVM doesn’t require the exception to be caught and handled.
Example of Unchecked Exceptions-No Such Element Exception.

An unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution. 
These are also called as Runtime Exceptions.
These include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API.
Runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.

Java compiler does not check runtime exception at compile time whether programmer handles them or not. 
If a runtime exception occurs in a method and programmer does not handle it, JVM terminates the program without the 
execution of rest of the code.
For example, if you have declared an array of size 5 in your program, and trying to call the 6th element of the array then 
an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception occurs.

ArithmeticException,ClassCastException ,NullPointerException ,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ,NegativeArraySizeException
    ArrayStoreException ,IllegalThreadStateException ,SecurityException, etc.
===================================================

Final Finally Finalize:-
============================
Final :  final can be initialized only once, they can be initialized during declaration 
            or in constructor if they are class fields

finally : try ,catch will always run once ,clean up can be done ,close()
          try(Connection c:c.getConn()){} //auto after try , try with resources

The finally block in java is used to put important codes such as clean up code 
e.g. closing the file or closing the connection. 
The finally block executes whether exception rise or not and whether exception handled or not.

finalise : not guaranteed to run , finalize method runs on garbage collection.

//Inner class :-
====================
class inside the class.For eg If ListIterator is non static inner class of List,then List object
needs to be created first and ListIterator object will have reference to list object.

InstanceOf (operator):-check Run time type.
======================================================
An instanceof in Java is a comparison operator which, given an object instance,
checks whether that instance is of a specified type (class/sub-class/interface) or not.
Just like other comparison operators, it returns true or false.

static class:-
=================
Static is like a normal top level class,inside namespace of outer class .
It's object is created directly without outer class object.
It does not have reference to its outer class object.
          class House{      static class Window{} }
new pkg.House.Window() //House object not needed to created window.

A static nested class may be instantiated without instantiating its outer class.
Inner classes can access both static and non-static members of the outer class.
A static class can access only the static members of the outer class.

Private class :- 
===================
This class is only accessible inside class.only inner class can be private.
 Only that class has access of it.

//Immutable class :
====================
It has private constructor, public method which calls private constructor and returns created object
no setter and getters
return copy if returning a reference type which is not immutable.  
    
The instance variable of the class is final i.e. we cannot change the value of it after creating an object.
The class is final so we cannot create the subclass.
There is no setter methods i.e. we have no option to change the value of the instance variable.

These points make this class as immutable.

Wrapper class:-
====================
A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types. 
When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, we can store primitive data types. 
In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.

Wrapper Class in Java
=========================
A Wrapper Class in Java is a class that encapsulates (wraps) a primitive data type into an object.
Java provides a wrapper class for each of its eight primitive data types:
byte → Byte short → Short
int → Integer long → Long
float → Float double → Double
char → Character boolean → Boolean

Why are Wrapper Classes Used?
Object Representation of Primitives:
Java works with objects in collections and frameworks like ArrayList, HashMap, and HashSet, which cannot store primitive
data types. Wrapper classes help convert primitive data types into objects using Autoboxing.

Utility Methods:
Wrapper classes provide useful methods for parsing, comparing, and converting data.
Example: Integer.parseInt(), Double.valueOf(), Character.isDigit().

Support for Generics:
Generics in Java only support objects, not primitive data types.
Wrapper classes allow the use of primitives within generic data structures.

Data Conversion:
Converting strings to numeric values using wrapper class methods like Integer.parseInt("123").

Null Support:
Unlike primitives, wrapper objects can hold a null value, making them suitable for representing the absence of a value.

import java.util.ArrayList;
public class WrapperExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Autoboxing: Primitive to Wrapper
int num = 10;
Integer wrappedNum = num;  // Autoboxing
        // Unboxing: Wrapper to Primitive
        int primitiveNum = wrappedNum;  // Unboxing
        // Using Wrapper class methods
        String str = "123";
        int parsedNum = Integer.parseInt(str);
        System.out.println("Parsed Number: " + parsedNum);
        // Using Wrapper in Collections
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(5);  // Autoboxing
        list.add(10);
        System.out.println("ArrayList: " + list);
    }
}
Key Points to Remember
Wrapper classes are immutable (cannot be changed once created).
They are part of the java.lang package.
Autoboxing and unboxing make working with wrapper classes seamless.
Using wrapper classes may lead to increased memory consumption compared to primitives.

ENumeration Interface:-
====================================
The Enumeration interface defines a means to retrieve successive elements from a data structure.
For example, Enumeration defines a method called nextElement that is used to get the next element in a data 
structure that contains multiple elements.

MAVEN
==========
Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). 
It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process like ANT. ... 
In short terms we can tell maven is a tool that can be used for building and managing any Java-based project.

SOLID:-
===========
S : is for Single Responsibility Principle :- a class or module should do one thing only.
O: is for Open/Closed Principle :-code entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
L:Liskov Substitution Principle:-any child type of a parent type should be able to stand in for that parent without things blowing up.
I :is for Interface Segregation Principle:- you should favor many, smaller, client-specific interfaces over one larger.
D is for Dependency Inversion:-encourages you to write code that depends upon abstractions rather than upon concrete details.

InputStreamReader:-
====================
An InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character streams: 
It reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset. 
The charset that it uses may be specified by name or may be given explicitly,
or the platform's default charset may be accepted.


✅ Understanding Object Slicing with Upcasting
Upcasting
===============
Upcasting is the process of converting a derived class object to a base class reference.
This is safe because the derived class object "is a" base class object (following the IS-A relationship).

What is Downcasting?
Downcasting is the process of converting a reference of a parent class (superclass) to a reference of its child class 
(subclass). It allows access to the specific methods and properties of the child class, which are not accessible using 
the parent class reference.
Downcasting is typically done manually using type casting in Java.
It is only possible when the object being referred to is actually an instance of the child class.

✅ Why is Downcasting Required?
Downcasting is generally required when:
Accessing Child Class Methods and Properties:
After upcasting (when a child object is referred to using a parent class reference), only the parent class methods are 
accessible. 
Downcasting is used to access the specialized methods of the child class.

Performing Type-Specific Operations:
If you have a collection of parent class objects, but need to invoke child class methods based on the actual type,
downcasting is necessary.

Using Polymorphism:
During runtime, when the actual object type is a subclass, downcasting ensures the correct method or behavior is accessed.

class Animal {
void sound() {
System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
}
}
class Dog extends Animal {
void bark() {
System.out.println("Dog barks");
}
}
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting (Child class object referred by Parent class reference)
animal.sound();  // Calls Animal's method
                                                          //Downcasting to access Dog specific methods
        if (animal instanceof Dog) { // Always check before downcasting
            Dog dog = (Dog) animal; // Downcasting
            dog.bark(); // Calls Dog's specific method
        } else {
            System.out.println("Downcasting is not possible.");
        }
    }
}
output- Animal makes a sound
Dog barks

If the object is not actually of the type being casted to, Java will throw a ClassCastException.
Always ensure that the object is compatible before downcasting.

✅ Conclusion
Downcasting is used to convert a parent class reference back to its original child class type to access child-specific
methods and properties.
It should be done carefully using the instanceof operator to avoid runtime exceptions.
It is typically used in scenarios involving polymorphism or collections of objects with mixed types.

Q- Explain with the help of example. What are problems with multiple inheritance?
Multiple Inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class, acquiring the properties and behaviors of
both. In Java, multiple inheritance using classes is not supported to avoid complexity and ambiguity.
However, multiple inheritance using interfaces is allowed.
The main reason Java doesn't support multiple inheritance using classes is to prevent ambiguity and conflicts that arise 
when two parent classes have methods with the same name. This is commonly referred to as the "Diamond Problem."
📌 Example of Diamond Problem (Multiple Inheritance Issue)
Consider a scenario where:
Class A has a method called display().
Classes B and C inherit from Class A and override the display() method.
Class D inherits from both B and C.
Now, if D tries to call the display() method, it will lead to confusion — which version of display() should be called?
This is the Diamond Problem.
class A {
void display() {
System.out.println("Display from Class A");
}
}
class B extends A {
void display() {
System.out.println("Display from Class B");
}
}
class C extends A {
void display() {
System.out.println("Display from Class C");
}
}
// Class D trying to inherit from both B and C // This is not allowed in Java
/
class D extends B, C {
void show() {
display(); // Ambiguity - which display() to call?
}
}
*/
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Not possible in Java
}
}
Java does not support multiple inheritance using classes to prevent the diamond problem.
However, Java supports multiple inheritance using interfaces because interfaces do not store any state and only contain
abstract methods (until Java 8 introduced default methods).

📌 Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces (Supported in Java)
Since interfaces only provide method signatures (not implementation), Java allows multiple inheritance using interfaces.
If there is any conflict (e.g., same default method in multiple interfaces), it can be resolved using explicit overriding.
Example of Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces
interface InterfaceA {
default void display() {
System.out.println("Display from InterfaceA");
}
}
interface InterfaceB {
default void display() {
System.out.println("Display from InterfaceB");
}
}
class ImplementingClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
    // Resolve ambiguity using explicit overriding
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Resolving ambiguity using InterfaceA");
        InterfaceA.super.display(); // Call InterfaceA's method
    }
}
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
ImplementingClass obj = new ImplementingClass();
obj.display();
}
}
Output:
Resolving ambiguity using InterfaceA
Display from InterfaceA
Explanation:
InterfaceA.super.display() is used to explicitly call display() from InterfaceA.
This approach allows Java to handle multiple inheritance safely without ambiguity.

✅ Problems with Multiple Inheritance (If It Were Allowed Using Classes)
Diamond Problem -As explained, the diamond problem leads to ambiguity in method calls.
Increased Complexity -Maintaining and understanding code becomes difficult when multiple parent classes have similar methods.
Data Management Issues -If multiple parent classes contain similar fields, it leads to data inconsistency and conflicts.
Constructor Chain Issues -Calling constructors from multiple parent classes can be problematic and lead to unpredictable behavior.
Performance Overhead -More complex inheritance structures would result in increased memory consumption and slower performance.
